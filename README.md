##  Phishing Detection using Machine Learning

A machine learning-based solution to detect phishing websites based on extracted URL features. This project uses models like Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost to classify websites as phishing or legitimate.

##  Features
- Preprocessing of raw data
- Feature selection and engineering
- ML models training and comparison
- Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curves

##  Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

##  Models Implemented
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

##  Dataset
The dataset used is from [Phishing Websites Data Set - UCI Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/phishing+websites).

##  How to Run
1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KArT4206/phishing-detection.git
cd phishing-detection
```
2. install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or the Python script.

##  Results
Highest Accuracy: 95.6% (Random Forest)

Confusion Matrix and ROC visualizations available

##  Future Scope
Integration with browser extensions

Real-time phishing detection system

Improved feature extraction from URLs

this is a ml that has pre-defined websites list that help to dectect the website is legit or phishing website. basically it is using the pre-listed websites it will compare with the input and give the result according to that input.

To run this ml:

1.download everyfiles in ur pc or computer.

2.then create a file and place all file into that file.

3.open the terminal in the created files.

4.type python app.py to run the app python code this will run all needed code to create a website in a local server.

5.in the terminal it will shows the http link you have to copy and paste in a browser to open the website.

6.that's it you are running the ml in a website form their you can give the url's that you wants to check.
